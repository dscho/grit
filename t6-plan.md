# T6 Plan

Generated from `data/test-files.csv` on 2026-06-03. Work highest failing counts first inside
dependency/topic groups. Mark an item `[~]` when claimed and `[x]` only after the harness row has
`failing=0`.

## Rev-List And Revision Traversal

- [x] `t6021-rev-list-exclude-hidden.sh` — 62/62 passing. Highest current t6 blocker;
  depends on rev-list option parsing, pseudo-ref globbing, and hidden-ref filtering.
- [x] `t6018-rev-list-glob.sh` — 95/95 passing after extending pseudo-ref glob and exclude
  handling across `rev-list`, `rev-parse`, and `shortlog`.
- [x] `t6002-rev-list-bisect.sh` — 53/53 passing after adding rev-list bisection
  midpoint selection, `--bisect-vars`, `--bisect-all`, and bisect-ref defaults.
- [x] `t6111-rev-list-treesame.sh` — 65/65 passing after dense TREESAME traversal,
  path-limited parent rewriting, ancestry-bottom pruning, simplify-merges path rewriting, and
  adjacent merge-parent topo ordering.
- [x] `t6600-test-reach.sh` — 47/47 passing after adding the
  upstream `test-tool reach` helper operations, first-parent `%(is-base)` selection,
  multi-base `for-each-ref --merged` filtering, `rev-list --maximal-only`, and
  symmetric-difference topo ordering.
- [x] `t6022-rev-list-missing.sh` — 40/40 passing after tolerating missing
  commits/objects in non-error missing modes, subtracting negative tree/blob object roots, and
  adding `--missing=print-info` plus `-z` output.
- [x] `t6006-rev-list-format.sh` — 80/80 passing after `%e`, empty custom-format
  line, named pretty header, advanced color-order fixes, `%C(auto)%H` log coloring, `show`
  conditional pretty placeholders, `show` `%b` trailing newline handling, reflog `%gD`/`%gd`
  formatting plus `%h` abbreviation, verbatim newline-only commit messages, `rev-list --oneline`
  and `--graph` acceptance, and pretty output encoding from `i18n.commitEncoding`.
- [x] `t6007-rev-list-cherry-pick-file.sh` — 23/23 passing after path-limited patch-id matching,
  `--cherry-mark` / `--cherry` marker/count semantics, duplicate patch-id matching, and empty-side
  symmetric range handling.
- [x] `t6012-rev-list-simplify.sh` — 42/42 passing after completing path-limited
  `--simplify-merges --show-pulls` graph ordering.
- [x] `t6000-rev-list-misc.sh` — 23/23 passing after completing path-limited object output,
  symmetric left/right ordering, indexed object roots/exclusions, raw `--header`, `-z` records,
  boundary incompatibility, and root replay for `rebase --force-rebase --root`.
- [x] `t6003-rev-list-topo-order.sh` — 36/36 passing after matching Git's graph-order
  `--topo-order` stack semantics and accepting raw numeric `--max-age` / `--min-age` cutoffs.
- [x] `t6019-rev-list-ancestry-path.sh` — 18/18 passing after matching Git's
  selected-range ancestry propagation, symmetric-log ancestry bottoms, path-limited ancestry-side
  TREESAME merge pruning, simplify-merges ancestry preservation, and `checkout -b start --`
  separator handling for the criss-cross setup.
- [x] `t6137-rev-parse-misc.sh` — 34/34 passing after making the synthetic
  fixture request its expected `master` initial branch under the harness.
- [x] `t6016-rev-list-graph-simplify-history.sh` — 12/12 passing after
  preserving path-limited `--simplify-merges` merge nodes for graph lane rendering.
- [x] `t6136-rev-list-date-range.sh` — 31/31 passing after making the synthetic
  fixture request its expected `master` initial branch under the harness.
- [x] `t6015-rev-list-show-all-parents.sh` — 38/38 passing after making the
  synthetic fixture request its expected `master` initial branch under the harness.
- [x] `t6138-rev-list-boundary.sh` — 29/29 passing after making the synthetic
  fixture request its expected `master` initial branch under the harness.
- [x] `t6001-rev-list-graft.sh` — 14/14 passing after making path-limited
  parent rewriting and graph ordering honor grafted parents.
- [x] `t6101-rev-parse-parents.sh` — 38/38 passing after making `rev-list`
  reuse the shared parent shorthand expansion for `^-` ranges.
- [x] `t6010-merge-base.sh` — 12/12 passing after default multi-commit
  `merge-base` used first-vs-rest semantics instead of octopus semantics.
- [x] `t6011-rev-list-with-bad-commit.sh` — 6/6 passing after packed
  object reads and fsck detect corrupt pack entries.
- [x] `t6013-rev-list-reverse-parents.sh` — 3/3 passing after
  `--reverse --boundary` prints boundary commits before the reversed commit stream.

## Merge Machinery

- [x] `t6423-merge-rename-directories.sh` — 80/82 passing, 0 failing, with 2 expected
  failures.
- [x] `t6438-submodule-directory-file-conflicts.sh` — 56/56 passing.
- [x] `t6430-merge-recursive.sh` — 36/36 passing after
  normal checkout stopped applying the rebase-only submodule replacement refusal and
  clean `merge-recursive` D/F auto-resolution kept the merged index while true
  D/F conflicts still exit non-zero and use commit OID suffixes for relocated
  conflicted files, alternate `GIT_INDEX_FILE` writes land in the selected index,
  and unchanged-base file sides do not create D/F conflicts.
