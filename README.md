# Grit — Git in Rust

Grit is a **from-scratch reimplementation of Git** in idiomatic Rust. The goal is to match Git's behavior closely enough that the upstream test suite (under `git/t/`) can be ported and run against this tool.

The Grit project is brought to you by the mad geniuses at [GitButler ⧓](https://gitbutler.com).

## Motivation

Why rewrite Git functionality into Rust? It's not about replacing Git, it's about having a feature-complete linkable library. It's similar to Gitoxide or libgit2/git2-rs, but using LLMs to try to acheive total feature parity by targeting the Git testing suite.

## Approach

This implementation has been written nearly entirely by AI coding agents with the goal of entirely passing the C Git testing suite. For details on how we accomplished this, see our [blog post](https://blog.gitbutler.com/true-grit).

The implementation is entirely in Rust, with most of the generic logic in the [grit-lib](https://crates.io/crates/grit-lib) library crate, and the Git-compatible CLI in the [grit-cli](https://crates.io/crates/grit-cli) crate which uses the library to provide a UI that passes the Git tests.

There is also a very simple alternative CLI called `grit-simple` (or `gs`) that is also installed with the install script and the only binary installed on Windows.

## Usability

While the `grit` command emulates `git` functionality enough to successfully run over 42k of it's tests, it has been nearly entirely written by agents and has not been used for realsies. It's probably currently unusably slow or completely broken in ways that are not exercised in the test suite.

Our current goal is to get all the tests to pass and then refactor to real usability (speed, API surface, etc) while being able to successfully test for regression easily. Try it out and either send a fix or report an issue for anything you find or ways you want to use it that it doesn't successfully do.

## Installation

To install the `grit` and `gs` CLIs via Bash, you can run our install script:

```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://grit-scm.com/install | sh
```

There are builds for Mac and Linux, (aarch64 and x86_64 for both). Linux ships both glibc and statically-linked musl binaries, so the installer works on distros like Alpine too — it auto-detects which one your system needs. Windows does not install `grit`, but does install the simple version `gs` that only does the basics.

## Updating

To update your version of Grit CLIs, you can run `grit update` or `gs update` and it will re-run the install script.

## grit-simple

The workspace also includes `grit-simple`, which installs the `gs` binary. It is not a Git-identical CLI; it is a simpler interface for common developer workflows built on `grit-lib`, portable to Windows.

`gs` treats status as the home screen and keeps the common path terse:

```sh
gs auth   # authenticate into github and store https auth tokens for fetch/push as your user
gs clone https://github.com/user/project
gs        # status dashboard
gs commit "message" # commit changes
gs switch -c topic
gs push
gs pull
```

It covers local work (`status`, `add`, `commit`, `branch`, `switch`, `merge`, `log`, `config`) plus remote basics (`remote add`, `clone`, `fetch`, `pull`, `push`) with plain-language output. Use `grit` when you need Git-compatible command behavior; use `gs` when you want the smaller workflow-oriented interface or something on Windows.

The Windows version also comes with `gs manager` which works as an interface to Windows Credential Manager to store `gs auth` tokens securely.
