//! `gs` — a small, opinionated command line interface backed by `grit-lib`.
//!
//! `gs` deliberately does not mirror Git's UX. It favors a single obvious way
//! to do the common thing, plain-language output, and a status screen that
//! doubles as the home base: running `gs` with no arguments shows you where you
//! are, what's changed, and what to do next.
