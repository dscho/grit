# Test Results

Updated: 2026-05-22

- `cargo build --release -p grit-cli`: pass.
- `cargo fmt`: run. `cargo fmt --check` still reports pre-existing formatting drift in unrelated files; those mechanical edits were not included in this scoped commit.
- `cargo check`: pass with existing warnings.
- `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty`: completed, but the workspace still reports many pre-existing clippy warnings; clippy also reported failed auto-fixes in unrelated files.
- `cargo test -p grit-lib --lib`: pass, 204/204.
- `cargo test --workspace`: skipped for this documentation/planning update.
- `./tests/harness/run.sh`: skipped; project uses `./scripts/run-tests.sh` for CSV/dashboard updates.
- Focus harness: `./scripts/run-tests.sh t1510-repo-setup.sh` pass, 109/109.
- Companion harness: `./scripts/run-tests.sh t1517-outside-repo.sh` still 185/191; first remaining failure is `git apply` outside a repository, not repo setup discovery.
- Phase 2 sparse verification: `./scripts/run-tests.sh t1011-read-tree-sparse-checkout.sh t1090-sparse-checkout-scope.sh t1092-sparse-checkout-compatibility.sh t6428-merge-conflicts-sparse.sh t6435-merge-sparse.sh t3705-add-sparse-checkout.sh t3602-rm-sparse-checkout.sh t7002-mv-sparse-checkout.sh`.
- Results from that run: `t6435-merge-sparse` pass 6/6; `t1011-read-tree-sparse-checkout` 21/23, `t1090-sparse-checkout-scope` 6/7, `t1092-sparse-checkout-compatibility` 48/106, `t6428-merge-conflicts-sparse` 1/2, `t3705-add-sparse-checkout` 15/20, `t3602-rm-sparse-checkout` 7/13, `t7002-mv-sparse-checkout` 4/22.
- Partial clone focus: `./scripts/run-tests.sh t0410-partial-clone.sh` improved to 36/38. Remaining failures are late partial-clone repack/gc/backfill cases after the promisor repack checks.
- Phase 2 partial-clone continuation: `cargo build --release -p grit-cli` passes with existing warnings.
- Focused partial clone: `t5616-partial-clone.sh --run=1-8`, `--run=34`, and `--run=35` pass.
- Harness partial clone: `./scripts/run-tests.sh t5616-partial-clone.sh` is 21/47 after clone/fetch filter work.
- Regression partial clone: `./scripts/run-tests.sh t0410-partial-clone.sh` remains 37/38.
- Phase 2 promisor continuation: `cargo build --release -p grit-cli` passes with existing warnings.
- Focused partial clone: `t5616-partial-clone.sh --run=1-10` passes after blame lazy-fetch hydration.
- Focused partial clone: `t5616-partial-clone.sh --run=1-18` now passes through test 16; remaining failures begin at shallow partial clone/refetch and trace2 maintenance checks.
- Harness partial clone: `./scripts/run-tests.sh t5616-partial-clone.sh` is 24/47 after `fetch-pack --stdin`, `blob:limit` filtering, and refetch negotiation work.
- Pre-commit: `cargo check` passes with existing warnings; `cargo test -p grit-lib --lib` passes 204/204.
- Pre-commit: `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` completed only with the existing warning backlog; clippy reported failed auto-fixes in unrelated files and no scoped clippy changes were kept.
- Phase 2 shallow partial clone: `cargo build --release -p grit-cli` passes with existing warnings.
- Focused partial clone: `t5616-partial-clone.sh --run=1-17` passes, including shallow `clone --depth=1 --filter=blob:none` plus `fetch --refetch --filter=blob:limit=999`.
- Harness partial clone: `./scripts/run-tests.sh t5616-partial-clone.sh` is 26/47 after shallow promisor marker and filtered-refetch marker trimming fixes.
- Pre-commit: `cargo fmt` ran; `cargo check` passes with existing warnings; `cargo test -p grit-lib --lib` passes 204/204.
- Pre-commit: `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` completed after sandbox escalation; it applied one unused-import cleanup and still reports the existing clippy warning backlog plus failed auto-fixes in unrelated files.
- Phase 2 HTTP promisor: focused `t0410-partial-clone.sh --run=38` passes after HTTP lazy fetch keeps received packs as promisor packs.
- Harness partial clone: `./scripts/run-tests.sh t0410-partial-clone.sh` passes 38/38 when run with local HTTP server binding allowed.
- Phase 2 upload-pack filter policy: focused `t5616-partial-clone.sh --run=1-28` passes tests 24-28 after enforcing `uploadpackfilter.*` config.
- Harness partial clone: `./scripts/run-tests.sh t5616-partial-clone.sh` is 32/47 after upload-pack filter policy validation.
